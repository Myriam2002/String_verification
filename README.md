# String Verification using Regular Expressions

This repository contains an implementation for verifying a string against a given regular expression. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for pattern matching and validation using regular expressions in Python.

## Overview

Regular expressions are powerful tools for matching and manipulating strings based on specific patterns. They are widely used in various applications, including text processing, data validation, and pattern recognition. This project aims to demonstrate how regular expressions can be utilized to verify whether a given string matches a specified pattern.

## Implementation

The implementation utilizes the regular expression module provided by Python's standard library. It allows users to define custom regular expressions using a set of predefined rules and syntax. The program takes a user-input string and checks if it matches the provided regular expression.
